# Notes for *C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition*

At this directory, I will upload my practice result and write my notes here.

**Noted:** I'm using Chinese version, so some of the text may differ from the original book.

## Chapter 7: Primitive Data Types

### 7.4 Type Conversion

#### 7.4.4 Forced Type Conversion

Example in book: 
```c
float f, frac_part;
frac_part = f - (int) f;
```

## Chapter 8: Array

## Misc

1. `sizeof(var)` return a long unsigned int. So we should format '%ld' expects argument of this type of data.
